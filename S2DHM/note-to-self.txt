(1) I switched off CUDA at two locations in pose_prediction/keypoint_association.py: line 57 and line 65 (Remember to turn it back on when using gpu!

(2) In file pose_prediction/solve_pnp.py: I added 3D_points in "Prediction" named tuple at line 7. And to subsequent output formats in line 53,74,86

(3) Added results folder

(4) Added my own run_featurePnP.py, run_featurePnP.ipynb, datasets/dataload_helpers.py, pose_prediction/sparse_to_dense_featuremetric_predictor.py

(5) Added import Optimizer_PnP (line 4) and image_shape (Line 18) parameters in configs/pose_prediction/sparse_to_dense_pose_prediction.gin

(6) Added import of OptimizerPnP (line 14) and calling optimizer in (line 120-123) in pose_prediction/sparse_to_dense_predictor.py

(7) Added "points_3d" in the output of _nearest_neighbor_prediction function (line 55) of pose_prediction/predictor.py
